## FizzBuzz
## What is this project?

Welcome! This project features a Java implementation of the classic FizzBuzz program. Itâ€™s designed as an introductory programming exercise, perfect for those new to coding.

### How the FizzBuzz Works

The FizzBuzz program loops through numbers from 1 to 100, applying simple rules to determine what to print:

Fizz: For numbers divisible by 3.
Buzz: For numbers divisible by 5.
FizzBuzz: For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
All other numbers print itself

### What You Will Learn
